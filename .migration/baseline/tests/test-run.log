🔀 Approach Comparison

We generated multiple approaches:

A. Speed Optimized
   Prioritize execution speed and minimal overhead
   Pros: Fast execution, Low resource usage, Quick feedback
   Cons: May skip some checks, Less comprehensive
   Effort: 5 minutes
   Quality: ★★★★

B. Quality Optimized
   Prioritize code quality and best practices
   Pros: High quality output, Comprehensive checks, Production-ready
   Cons: Slower execution, More resources needed
   Effort: 15 minutes
   Quality: ★★★★★

C. Balanced
   Balance between speed and quality
   Pros: Good quality, Reasonable speed, Practical
   Cons: Not the fastest, Not the highest quality
   Effort: 10 minutes
   Quality: ★★★★
