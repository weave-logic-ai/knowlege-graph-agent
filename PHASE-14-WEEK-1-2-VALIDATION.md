2. **Complexity**: Reduced 88.1% orphan rate (vs initial 55% estimate) - problem was worse than expected
3. **Tool Output**: Mixed JSON/text output required adjustment, but tools still functional
4. **Integration**: Successfully integrated 9 archived documents with modern equivalents

### Innovations Introduced 🚀

1. **PROJECT-TIMELINE.md**: Central chronological hub linking all 14 phases
2. **Superseded-by Pattern**: Archive documents now link to modern equivalents
3. **Multi-Factor Scoring**: Connection suggestion algorithm with 6 scoring factors
4. **Mermaid Visualizations**: Color-coded graph views (hub/cluster/orphan views)
5. **Directory Hub Pattern**: One hub per major directory for scalable navigation
