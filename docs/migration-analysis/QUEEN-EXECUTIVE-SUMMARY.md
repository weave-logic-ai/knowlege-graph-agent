| **Phase 3**: Enhanced Files | 5-7 days | MEDIUM | 27 | Merge Phase 12 enhancements |
| **Phase 4**: Workflow Integration | 3-4 days | LOW | 10 | Integrate unique workflows |
| **Phase 5**: Conflict Resolution | 4-6 days | HIGH | 12 | Manual merge complex conflicts |
| **Phase 6**: Cleanup & Validation | 2-3 days | LOW | N/A | Final validation, documentation |

**Total Estimated Duration**: 21-32 days

## 🎯 Queen's Strategic Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Next 24 Hours)

1. **Review All Documentation**
   - Tech lead review of migration strategy
   - Team walkthrough of execution plan
   - Address questions and concerns

2. **Stakeholder Alignment**
   - Confirm 21-32 day timeline acceptable
   - Allocate resources (2-3 developers)
   - Schedule daily standup for migration period

3. **Environment Preparation**
   - Ensure dev environment has adequate space (500+ MB)
   - Set up git branches for migration work
   - Test backup/restore procedures

### Critical Success Factors

✅ **MUST PRESERVE**:
- All 42 weaver-unique files (Phase 12 production enhancements)
- Learning orchestrator, feedback system, adaptation engine
- Complete workflow system (10 files)
- Advanced chunking with embeddings
- Perception manager and search capabilities

✅ **SAFETY MEASURES**:
- 3-level rollback system (git + tarball backups)
- Test validation after each phase
- Performance benchmarking throughout
- Daily progress tracking

✅ **QUALITY GATES**:
- Zero build errors at each phase
- Zero type errors at each phase
- Zero test failures at each phase
- <5% performance degradation

### Risk Mitigation Strategy

**High-Risk Areas**:
1. Phase 5 conflict resolution (12 files - expert manual merge required)
2. Type system unification (complex type conflicts)
3. Test coverage maintenance (≥85% throughout)
4. Performance preservation (<20% degradation)

**Mitigation**:
- Phased approach with validation checkpoints
- Full backups before each phase
- Rollback procedures tested in Phase 1
- Continuous integration testing
