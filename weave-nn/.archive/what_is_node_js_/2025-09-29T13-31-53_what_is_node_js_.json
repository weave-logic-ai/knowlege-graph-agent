  "answer": "Node.js is an **open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment** that allows developers to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser, primarily for building fast, scalable server-side and networking applications[2][3][4][6]. It is **not a programming language or a framework**, but rather an environment that uses the **V8 JavaScript engine** (the same engine as Google Chrome) to run JavaScript on the server side[2][6].\n\n**Key Features and Architecture:**\n\n- **Event-Driven, Non-Blocking I/O:** Node.js uses an **asynchronous, event-driven architecture**. This means it can handle many simultaneous connections efficiently without waiting for one operation to finish before starting another. This is achieved through an **event loop** that manages callbacks and asynchronous operations, making Node.js highly scalable and suitable for real-time applications like chat servers, streaming services, and APIs[1][2][3][4][6].\n\n- **Single-Threaded Model:** While Node.js operates on a single thread, it can handle multiple concurrent operations using non-blocking I/O. For CPU-intensive tasks, Node.js can utilize additional threads via modules like `worker_threads`[2].\n\n- **Cross-Platform:** Node.js runs on various operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and macOS, making it versatile for different deployment environments[2][3][6].\n\n- **Rich Ecosystem (npm):** Node.js has a vast package ecosystem called **npm (Node Package Manager)**, which provides access to over a million reusable libraries and tools for rapid development[2][4].\n\n- **JavaScript Everywhere:** Node.js enables developers to use JavaScript for both client-side and server-side programming, unifying web application development around a single language[2][3][4][6].\n\n**How Node.js Works:**\n\n- When a Node.js application receives a request (such as a web request or file operation), it places the request in an event queue.\n- The **event loop** continuously checks this queue and processes each request asynchronously.\n- If a request involves I/O (like reading a file or querying a database), Node.js offloads it to the system kernel or a worker thread, allowing the main thread to continue processing other events.\n- Once the I/O operation completes, a callback function is executed to handle the result[1][2][3][4].\n\n**Common Use Cases:**\n\n- **Web servers and APIs:** Node.js is ideal for building RESTful APIs, web servers, and microservices due to its efficiency and scalability[2][3][4][6].\n- **Real-time applications:** Such as chat apps, online gaming, and live collaboration tools, where low latency and high concurrency are crucial[2][4][6].\n- **Streaming and data-intensive applications:** Node.js excels at handling streaming data and large numbers of concurrent connections, making it suitable for video streaming and IoT (Internet of Things) applications[2][4][5].\n- **Command-line tools and automation scripts:** Developers use Node.js to create CLI tools and automate tasks[2][4][6].\n\n**Notable Companies Using Node.js:**\nMajor organizations such as **Netflix, PayPal, LinkedIn, Walmart, Uber, NASA, and eBay** use Node.js for various backend services due to its performance and scalability[4].\n\n**Summary Table: Node.js at a Glance**\n\n| Aspect                | Description                                                                 |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Type                  | JavaScript runtime environment                                              |\n| Engine                | V8 (Google Chrome’s JavaScript engine)                                      |\n| Architecture          | Event-driven, non-blocking, single-threaded (with support for worker threads)|\n| Main Use Cases        | Web servers, APIs, real-time apps, streaming, IoT, CLI tools                |\n| Package Ecosystem     | npm (Node Package Manager)                                                  |\n| Supported Platforms   | Windows, Linux, macOS, and more                                             |\n| Not a Framework       | Node.js is not a framework or language, but an environment                  |\n\n**In summary:** Node.js revolutionized server-side development by enabling JavaScript to run outside the browser, offering high performance, scalability, and a unified language for both client and server development[2][3][4][6].",

      "snippet": "**Node.js** is a cross-platform, open-source JavaScript runtime environment that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more. Node.js runs on the V8 JavaScript engine, and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.\n\nNode.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and server-side scripting. The ability to run JavaScript code on the server is often used to generate dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a \"JavaScript everywhere\" paradigm, unifying web-application development around a single programming language, as opposed to using different languages for the server- versus client-side programming.\n\nNode.js has an event-driven architecture capable of asynchronous I/O. These design choices aim to optimize throughput and scalability in web applications with many input/output operations, as well as for real-time Web applications (e.g., real-time communication programs and browser games).\n\nThe Node.js distributed development project was previously governed by the Node.js Foundation, and has now merged with the JS Foundation to form the OpenJS Foundation. OpenJS Foundation is facilitated by the Linux Foundation's Collaborative Projects program.... ## History\n\nNode.js was initially written by Ryan Dahl in 2009, about 13 years after the introduction of the first server-side JavaScript environment, Netscape's LiveWire Pro Web. The initial release supported only Linux and Mac OS X. Its development and maintenance was led by Dahl and later sponsored by Joyent.\n\nDahl criticized the limited capability of Apache HTTP Server to handle many (10,000+) concurrent connections, as well as the dominant programming paradigm of sequential programming, in which applications could block entire processes or cause the creation of multiple execution stacks for simultaneous connections.\n\nDahl demonstrated the project at the inaugural European JSConf on November 8, 2009. Node.js combined Google's V8 JavaScript engine, an event loop, and a low-level I/O API.\n\nIn January 2010, a package manager was introduced for the Node.js environment called npm. The package manager allows programmers to publish and share Node.js packages, along with the accompanying source code, and is designed to simplify the installation, update and uninstallation of packages.\n\nIn June 2011, Microsoft and Joyent implemented a native Windows version of Node.js. The first Node.js build supporting Windows was released in July 2011.\n\nIn January 2012, Dahl yielded management of the project to npm creator Isaac Schlueter. In January 2014, Schlueter announced that Timothy J. Fontaine would lead the project.\n\nIn December 2014, Fedor Indutny created io.js, a fork of Node.js created because of dissatisfaction with Joyent's governance as an open-governance alternative with a separate technical committee. The goal was to enable a structure that would be more receptive to community input, including the updating of io.js with the latest Google V8 JavaScript engine releases, diverging from Node.js's approach at that time.\n\nThe Node.js Foundation, formed to reconcile Node.js and io.js under a unified banner, was announced in February 2015. The merger was realized in September 2015 with Node.js v0.12 and io.js v3.3 combining into Node v4.0. This merge brought V8 ES6 features into Node.js and started a long-term support release cycle. By 2016, the io.js website recommended returning to Node.js and announced no further io.js releases, effectively ending the fork and solidifying the merger's success.\n\nIn 2019, the JS Foundation and Node.js Foundation merged to form the OpenJS Foundation.... ### Branding\n\nThe Node.js logo features a green hexagon with overlapping bands to represent the cross-platform nature of the runtime. The Rocket Turtle was chosen as the official Node.js mascot in February 2024 following a design contest.... ## Overview\n\nNode.js allows the creation of web servers and networking tools using JavaScript and a collection of \"modules\" that handle various core functionalities. Modules are provided for file system I/O, networking (DNS, HTTP, TCP, TLS/SSL or UDP), binary data (buffers), cryptography functions, data streams and other core functions. Node.js's modules use an API designed to reduce the complexity of writing server applications.\n\nJavaScript is the only language that Node.js supports natively, but many compile-to-JS languages are available. As a result, Node.js applications can be written in CoffeeScript, Dart, TypeScript, ClojureScript and others.\n\nNode.js is primarily used to build network programs such as web servers. The most significant difference between Node.js and PHP is that most functions in PHP block until completion (commands execute only after previous commands finish), while Node.js functions are non-blocking (commands execute concurrently and use callbacks to signal completion or failure).\n\nNode.js is officially supported by Linux, macOS and Microsoft Windows 8.1 and Server 2012 (and later), with Tier 2 support for SmartOS and IBM AIX and experimental support for FreeBSD. OpenBSD also works, and LTS versions are available for IBM i (AS/400). The source code may also be built on similar operating systems that are not officially supported, such as NonStop OS and Unix servers.... ### Platform architecture\n\nNode.js enables development of fast web servers in JavaScript using event-driven programming. Developers can create scalable servers without using threading by using a simplified model that uses callbacks to signal the completion of a task. Node.js connects the ease of a scripting language (JavaScript) with the power of Unix network programming.\n\nNode.js was built on top of Google's V8 JavaScript engine since it was open-sourced under the BSD license, and it contains comprehensive support for fundamental protocols such as HTTP, DNS and TCP. JavaScript's existing popularity made Node.js accessible to the web-development community.\n\n### Industry support\n\nThere are thousands of open-source libraries for Node.js, most of which are hosted on the npm website. Multiple developer conferences and events are held that support the Node.js community, including NodeConf, Node Interactive, and Node Summit, as well as a number of regional events.\n\nThe open-source community has developed web frameworks to accelerate the development of applications. Such frameworks include Express.js, Socket.IO, Sails.js, Next.js and Meteor. Various packages have also been created for interfacing with other languages or runtime environments such as Microsoft .NET.\n\nModern desktop IDEs provide editing and debugging features specifically for Node.js applications. Such IDEs include Atom, Brackets, JetBrains WebStorm, Microsoft Visual Studio (with Node.js Tools for Visual Studio, or TypeScript with Node definitions), NetBeans, Nodeclipse Enide Studio (Eclipse-based) and Visual Studio Code. Some online IDEs also support Node.js, such as Codeanywhere, Eclipse Che, Cloud9 IDE and the visual flow editor in Node-RED.\n\nNode.js is supported across a number of cloud-hosting platforms such as Jelastic, Google Cloud Platform, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Azure Web Apps and Joyent.... ## Project governance\n\nIn 2015, various branches of the greater Node.js community began working under the vendor-neutral Node.js Foundation. The stated purpose of the organization \"is to enable widespread adoption and help accelerate development of Node.js and other related modules through an open governance model that encourages participation, technical contribution, and a framework for long-term stewardship by an ecosystem invested in Node.js' success.\"\n\nThe Node.js Foundation Technical Steering Committee (TSC) is the technical governing body of the Node.js Foundation. The TSC is responsible for the core Node.js repo as well as dependent and adjacent projects. Generally the TSC delegates the administration of these projects to working groups or committees. The LTS group that manages long term supported releases is one such group. Other current groups include Website, Streams, Build, Diagnostics, i18n, Evangelism, Docker, Addon API, Benchmarking, Post-mortem, Intl, Documentation, and Testing.\n\nIn August 2017, a third of the TSC members resigned due to a dispute related to the project's code of conduct.\n\n**Current TSC Members**\n|Username|Full Name|\n|--|--|\n|aduh95|Antoine du Hamel|\n|anonrig|Yagiz Nizipli|\n|benjamingr|Benjamin Gruenbaum|\n|BridgeAR|Ruben Bridgewater|\n|gireeshpunathil|Gireesh Punathil|\n|jasnell|James M Snell|\n|joyeecheung|Joyee Cheung|\n|legendecas|Chengzhong Wu|\n|marco-ippolito|Marco Ippolito|\n|mcollina|Matteo Collina|\n|mhdawson|Michael Dawson|\n|RafaelGSS|Rafael Gonzaga|\n|richardlau|Richard Lau|\n|ronag|Robert Nagy|\n|ruyadorno|Ruy Adorno|\n|ShogunPanda|Paolo Insogna|\n|targos|Michaël Zasso|\n|tniessen|Tobias Nießen|\n\n## References\n\n## Further reading\n\n## External links\n- Official website\n\nCategories: - 2009 software\n- Free software programmed in C++\n- Free software programmed in JavaScript\n- JavaScript libraries\n- Joyent\n- Linux Foundation projects\n- Software using the MIT license"

      "snippet": "# Introduction to Node.js\n\nNode.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. It is a popular tool for almost any kind of project!\n\nNode.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine, the core of Google Chrome, outside of the browser. This allows Node.js to be very performant.\n\nA Node.js app runs in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request. Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library that prevent JavaScript code from blocking. In addition, libraries in Node.js are generally written using non-blocking paradigms. Accordingly, blocking behavior is the exception rather than the norm in Node.js.\n\nWhen Node.js performs an I/O operation, like reading from the network, accessing a database or the filesystem, instead of blocking the thread and wasting CPU cycles waiting, Node.js will resume the operations when the response comes back.\n\nThis allows Node.js to handle thousands of concurrent connections with a single server without introducing the burden of managing thread concurrency, which could be a significant source of bugs.\n\nNode.js has a unique advantage because millions of frontend developers that write JavaScript for the browser are now able to write the server-side code in addition to the client-side code without the need to learn a completely different language.\n\nIn Node.js the new ECMAScript standards can be used without problems, as you don't have to wait for all your users to update their browsers - you are in charge of deciding which ECMAScript version to use by changing the Node.js version, and you can also enable specific experimental features by running Node.js with flags.... ## An Example Node.js Application\n\nThe most common example Hello World of Node.js is a web server:\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\n\nconst { createServer } = require('node:http');\n\nconst hostname = '127.0.0.1';\n\nconst port = 3000;\n\nconst server = createServer((req, res) => {\n\nres.statusCode = 200;\n\nres.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');\n\nres.end('Hello World');\n\n});\n\nserver.listen(port, hostname, () => {\n\nconsole.log(`Server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`);\n\n});\n\n```\n\nTo run this snippet, save it as a\n\n`server.js` file and run\n\n`node server.js` in your terminal.\n\nIf you use mjs version of the code, you should save it as a\n\n`server.mjs` file and run\n\n`node server.mjs` in your terminal.\n\nThis code first includes the Node.js\n\n`http` module.\n\nNode.js has a fantastic standard library, including first-class support for networking.\n\nThe\n\n`createServer()` method of\n\n`http` creates a new HTTP server and returns it.\n\nThe server is set to listen on the specified port and host name. When the server is ready, the callback function is called, in this case informing us that the server is running.\n\nWhenever a new request is received, the\n\n`request` event is called, providing two objects: a request (an\n\n`http.IncomingMessage` object) and a response (an\n\n`http.ServerResponse` object).\n\nThose 2 objects are essential to handle the HTTP call.\n\nThe first provides the request details. In this simple example, this is not used, but you could access the request headers and request data.\n\nThe second is used to return data to the caller.\n\nIn this case with:\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\n\nres.statusCode = 200;\n\n```\n\nwe set the\n\n`statusCode` property to\n\n`200`, to indicate a successful response.\n\nWe set the\n\n`Content-Type` header:\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\n\nres.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');\n\n```\n\nand we close the response, adding the content as an argument to\n\n`end()`:\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\n\nres.end('Hello World\\n');\n\n```\n\nIf you haven't already done so, download Node.js."

      "snippet": "If we talk about any application then the part with which the user is interacting is basically the frontend of our website whereas there are many things which happen in the background or in the backend of our website. Basically there are three parts of any application, one is Frontend with which the users are interacting, then comes to the backend server and backend database. For backend servers we can use NodeJS, Java, Python, etc. and for backend databases we use relational or non-relational databases.\n\nWhenever a client requests something from the client side of the application what happens is , the request is first sent to the server and then in that server some processing or calculations goes on for the validation of the client side request and after doing all such validation a response is sent to the client side. Basically for doing all such calculations and processing , this NodeJs framework of JavaScript is used.\n\nFor running our web applications outside the client’s browser , NodeJS is basically used as an open-source and cross platform JavaScript runtime environment.For running the server side applications we use this.For building the I/O intensive applications like video streaming sites ,online chatting applications and many other applications , it is used. Many established tech giant companies and newly created start-ups are using NodeJs framework in their company.\n\nIn 2009, NodeJs was developed by a guy called Ryan Dahla and the current version of NodeJs is v16.9.0.... ## What is Node.js?\n\nNode.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment and library for running web applications outside the client's browser. Ryan Dahl developed it in 2009, and its latest iteration, version 15.14, was released in April 2021. Developers use Node.js to create server-side web applications, and it is perfect for data-intensive applications since it uses an asynchronous, event-driven model.\n\nRelevant Read: What is NodeJS?\n\nNow that we know what is Node, let's look at why it is so prevalent in web development.\n\n## How Node.js Works\n\nNode.js is a runtime environment that allows JavaScript to be executed on the server side. It is built on the V8 JavaScript engine from Chrome, which compiles JavaScript into efficient machine code. Node.js operates on a single-threaded event-driven architecture, utilizing an event loop to handle multiple concurrent operations without blocking.\n\nWhen a client sends a request to a Node.js server, the request is added to an event queue. The event loop continuously checks this queue and processes each request. If a request involves an I/O operation, Node.js offloads it to the system kernel, which handles it asynchronously. Once the I/O operation is complete, the kernel notifies Node.js, executing the corresponding callback function.\n\nThis non-blocking I/O and event-driven model allows Node.js to handle many simultaneous connections efficiently, making it ideal for building scalable, high-performance network applications.... ## Why Do We Use NodeJs?\n\nThere are many reasons for which we prefer using NodeJs for the server side of our application, some of them are discussed in the following:\n\n- NodeJs is built on Google Chrome’s V8 engine, and for this reason its execution time is very fast and it runs very quickly.\n\n- There are more than 50,000 bundles available in the Node Package Manager and for that reason developers can import any of the packages any time according to their needed functionality for which a lot of time is saved.\n\n- As NodeJs do not need to wait for an API to return data , so for building real time and data intensive web applications, it is very useful. It is totally asynchronous in nature that means it is totally non-blocking.\n\n- The loading time for an audio or video is reduced by NodeJs because there is better synchronization of the code between the client and server for having the same code base.\n\n- As NodeJs is open-source and it is nothing but a JavaScript framework , so for the developers who are already used to JavaScript, for them starting developing their projects with NodeJs is very easy.... ## Is Node.js a Programming Language?\n\nNode.js is not a programming language; it is a runtime environment allowing you to execute JavaScript code on the server side, outside a web browser. Built on the V8 JavaScript engine from Chrome, Node.js compiles JavaScript into machine code for efficient execution. It extends JavaScript capabilities by providing additional features and libraries for server-side development, such as file system access, network communication, and asynchronous I/O operations.\n\nWhile JavaScript is the programming language used with Node.js, the runtime environment provides the tools and frameworks to build scalable and high-performance server applications. Node.js’s non-blocking, event-driven architecture makes it ideal for real-time applications, web servers, APIs, and more. In summary, Node.js is a robust environment that leverages JavaScript to enable server-side programming, but it is not a programming language.\n\n## Node.js Architecture\n\nNow that we established what is Node, let’s dig into its architecture. Node.js operates on a single-thread, allowing it to handle thousands of simultaneous event loops. Here’s a diagram, provided by Sinform.com, that best illustrates Node.js architecture.... ## Parts of Node.js\n\nFig: Parts of Node.js\n\nNow, let's go through each part of Node.js to get a better understanding of the server-side platform as a whole.\n\n### Modules\n\nModules are like JavaScript libraries that can be used in a Node.js application to include a set of functions. In order to include a module in a Node.js application, use the require() function with the parenthesis containing the name of the module.\n\nFig: Include a module in Node.js\n\nNode.js has many modules that provide the basic functionality needed for a web application. Some of them are mentioned in this table:\n\nFig: Node.js modules table\n\n### Console\n\nThe console is a module that provides a method for debugging that is similar to the basic JavaScript console provided by internet browsers. It prints messages to stdout and stderr.\n\nFig: Node.js console\n\n### Cluster\n\nNode.js is built-on on the concept of single-threaded programming. Cluster is a module that allows multi-threading by creating child processes that share the same server port and run simultaneously.\n\nA cluster can be added to an application in the following way:\n\nFig: Add cluster in Node.js\n\n### Global\n\nGlobal objects in Node.js are available in all modules. These objects are functions, modules, strings, etc. Some Node.js global objects are mentioned in the table below:\n\nFig: Global objects table... ## Applications of Node.js\n\nNode.js is a versatile runtime environment widely used for building various applications due to its efficiency and scalability. Here are some typical applications of Node.js:\n\n- Web Servers: Node.js is ideal for building fast and scalable web servers that handle numerous simultaneous connections with high throughput.\n\n- Real-Time Applications: It excels in real-time applications like chat applications, online gaming, and live collaboration tools, where real-time data updates are crucial.\n\n- APIs and Microservices: Node.js is commonly used to create RESTful APIs and microservices, facilitating communication between services in a distributed architecture.\n\n- Single-Page Applications (SPAs): Node.js serves and handles the backend logic for single-page applications, enhancing user experience with smooth, dynamic content updates.\n\n- Streaming Applications: Its asynchronous nature makes Node.js suitable for data streaming applications, such as video streaming services or real-time data processing.\n\n- Command-Line Tools: Developers use Node.js to create command-line tools and scripts that automate various tasks, leveraging its rich ecosystem of packages.\n\n- Internet of Things (IoT): Thanks to its event-driven architecture, Node.js is used in IoT applications to handle data from numerous devices in real time.\n\n## Who Uses NodeJs?\n\nWell in 2025, there are 15+ popular companies who are using NodeJs .\n\nCompanies like NASA, Trello, Netflix, PayPal, LinkedIn, Walmart, Uber, Twitter, Yahoo, eBay, GoDaddy etc are using NodeJs.... ## NPM: Node Package Manager\n\nNPM is a popular Node.js package library and the jewel in the crown of the Node.js community. It has millions of downloadable libraries, organized according to specific requirements, and is the largest software registry in the world. NPM is free. These libraries are growing fast to this very day, and they strengthen the Node.js community.... ## Conclusion\n\nNode.js is a powerful and versatile runtime environment that has revolutionized server-side programming by bringing JavaScript to the backend. Leveraging the V8 JavaScript engine, Node.js compiles code into efficient machine code, enabling high-performance execution. Its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model allows developers to easily build scalable and responsive applications capable of handling numerous concurrent connections. From web servers and real-time applications to APIs and IoT solutions, Node.js's robust ecosystem and rich library support make it a popular choice among developers.\n\nIn essence, Node.js extends JavaScript's capabilities beyond the browser, providing a robust platform for modern server-side development. To further enhance your development skills and broaden your expertise, consider pursuing Java Certification Training. This training can complement your knowledge of Node.js, making you a more versatile and sought-after developer in the industry."

(this runs first!)');\n\nIn this example:\n\n1. We load the built-in\n   ```\n   fs\n   ```\n   module\n2. We call\n   ```\n   readFile\n   ```\n   to read a file\n3. Node.js continues to the next line while reading the file\n4. When the file is read, our callback function runs\n\nThis non-blocking behavior lets Node.js handle many requests efficiently.... ## What Can Node.js Do?\n- **Web Servers**: Create fast, scalable network applications\n- **File Operations**: Read, write, and manage files on the server\n- **Database Interaction**: Work with databases like MongoDB, MySQL, and more\n- **APIs**: Build RESTful services and GraphQL APIs\n- **Real-time**: Handle WebSockets for live applications\n- **CLI Tools**: Create command-line applications\n\n### Example: Simple Web Server\n\nconst http = require('http'); http.createServer((req, res) => { res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'}); res.end('Hello World!'); }).listen(8080);\n\n## What is a Node.js File?\n\nNode.js files contain code that runs on the server. They usually have the\n```\n.js\n```\nextension and can be started with the\n```\nnode\n```\ncommand.\n\n- Node.js files run tasks when certain events happen (like a web request)\n- They must be started on the server to have any effect\n- They use JavaScript syntax\n\n### Example: Running a Node.js File\n\nnode app.js\n\n## Node.js Versions & LTS:\n\nNode.js releases a new major version every six months.\n\nFor stability, use an **LTS (Long Term Support)** version for production projects."

Consequently, Node.js represents a \"JavaScript everywhere\" paradigm, unifying web-application development around a single programming language, as opposed to using different languages for the server- versus client-side programming.\n\nNode.js has an event-driven architecture capable of asynchronous I/O. These design choices aim to optimize throughput and scalability in web applications with many input/output operations, as well as for real-time Web applications (e.g., real-time communication programs and browser games).\n\nThe Node.js distributed development project was previously governed by the Node.js Foundation, and has now merged with the JS Foundation to form the OpenJS Foundation. OpenJS Foundation is facilitated by the Linux Foundation's Collaborative Projects program.... ## History\n\nNode.js was initially written by Ryan Dahl in 2009, about 13 years after the introduction of the first server-side JavaScript environment, Netscape's LiveWire Pro Web. The initial release supported only Linux and Mac OS X. Its development and maintenance was led by Dahl and later sponsored by Joyent.\n\nDahl criticized the limited capability of Apache HTTP Server to handle many (10,000+) concurrent connections, as well as the dominant programming paradigm of sequential programming, in which applications could block entire processes or cause the creation of multiple execution stacks for simultaneous connections.\n\nDahl demonstrated the project at the inaugural European JSConf on November 8, 2009. Node.js combined Google's V8 JavaScript engine, an event loop, and a low-level I/O API.\n\nIn January 2010, a package manager was introduced for the Node.js environment called npm. The package manager allows programmers to publish and share Node.js packages, along with the accompanying source code, and is designed to simplify the installation, update and uninstallation of packages.\n\nIn June 2011, Microsoft and Joyent implemented a native Windows version of Node.js. The first Node.js build supporting Windows was released in July 2011.\n\nIn January 2012, Dahl yielded management of the project to npm creator Isaac Schlueter. In January 2014, Schlueter announced that Timothy J. Fontaine would lead the project.\n\nIn December 2014, Fedor Indutny created io.js, a fork of Node.js created because of dissatisfaction with Joyent's governance as an open-governance alternative with a separate technical committee. The goal was to enable a structure that would be more receptive to community input, including the updating of io.js with the latest Google V8 JavaScript engine releases, diverging from Node.js's approach at that time.\n\nThe Node.js Foundation, formed to reconcile Node.js and io.js under a unified banner, was announced in February 2015. The merger was realized in September 2015 with Node.js v0.12 and io.js v3.3 combining into Node v4.0. This merge brought V8 ES6 features into Node.js and started a long-term support release cycle. By 2016, the io.js website recommended returning to Node.js and announced no further io.js releases, effectively ending the fork and solidifying the merger's success.\n\nIn 2019, the JS Foundation and Node.js Foundation merged to form the OpenJS Foundation.... ### Branding\n\nThe Node.js logo features a green hexagon with overlapping bands to represent the cross-platform nature of the runtime. The Rocket Turtle was chosen as the official Node.js mascot in February 2024 following a design contest.... ## Overview\n\nNode.js allows the creation of web servers and networking tools using JavaScript and a collection of \"modules\" that handle various core functionalities. Modules are provided for file system I/O, networking (DNS, HTTP, TCP, TLS/SSL or UDP), binary data (buffers), cryptography functions, data streams and other core functions. Node.js's modules use an API designed to reduce the complexity of writing server applications.\n\nJavaScript is the only language that Node.js supports natively, but many compile-to-JS languages are available. As a result, Node.js applications can be written in CoffeeScript, Dart, TypeScript, ClojureScript and others.\n\nNode.js is primarily used to build network programs such as web servers. The most significant difference between Node.js and PHP is that most functions in PHP block until completion (commands execute only after previous commands finish), while Node.js functions are non-blocking (commands execute concurrently and use callbacks to signal completion or failure).\n\nNode.js is officially supported by Linux, macOS and Microsoft Windows 8.1 and Server 2012 (and later), with Tier 2 support for SmartOS and IBM AIX and experimental support for FreeBSD. OpenBSD also works, and LTS versions are available for IBM i (AS/400). The source code may also be built on similar operating systems that are not officially supported, such as NonStop OS and Unix servers.... ### Platform architecture\n\nNode.js enables development of fast web servers in JavaScript using event-driven programming. Developers can create scalable servers without using threading by using a simplified model that uses callbacks to signal the completion of a task. Node.js connects the ease of a scripting language (JavaScript) with the power of Unix network programming.\n\nNode.js was built on top of Google's V8 JavaScript engine since it was open-sourced under the BSD license, and it contains comprehensive support for fundamental protocols such as HTTP, DNS and TCP. JavaScript's existing popularity made Node.js accessible to the web-development community.\n\n### Industry support\n\nThere are thousands of open-source libraries for Node.js, most of which are hosted on the npm website. Multiple developer conferences and events are held that support the Node.js community, including NodeConf, Node Interactive, and Node Summit, as well as a number of regional events.\n\nThe open-source community has developed web frameworks to accelerate the development of applications. Such frameworks include Express.js, Socket.IO, Sails.js, Next.js and Meteor. Various packages have also been created for interfacing with other languages or runtime environments such as Microsoft .NET.\n\nModern desktop IDEs provide editing and debugging features specifically for Node.js applications. Such IDEs include Atom, Brackets, JetBrains WebStorm, Microsoft Visual Studio (with Node.js Tools for Visual Studio, or TypeScript with Node definitions), NetBeans, Nodeclipse Enide Studio (Eclipse-based) and Visual Studio Code. Some online IDEs also support Node.js, such as Codeanywhere, Eclipse Che, Cloud9 IDE and the visual flow editor in Node-RED.\n\nNode.js is supported across a number of cloud-hosting platforms such as Jelastic, Google Cloud Platform, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Azure Web Apps and Joyent.... ## Project governance\n\nIn 2015, various branches of the greater Node.js community began working under the vendor-neutral Node.js Foundation. The stated purpose of the organization \"is to enable widespread adoption and help accelerate development of Node.js and other related modules through an open governance model that encourages participation, technical contribution, and a framework for long-term stewardship by an ecosystem invested in Node.js' success.\"\n\nThe Node.js Foundation Technical Steering Committee (TSC) is the technical governing body of the Node.js Foundation. The TSC is responsible for the core Node.js repo as well as dependent and adjacent projects. Generally the TSC delegates the administration of these projects to working groups or committees. The LTS group that manages long term supported releases is one such group. Other current groups include Website, Streams, Build, Diagnostics, i18n, Evangelism, Docker, Addon API, Benchmarking, Post-mortem, Intl, Documentation, and Testing.\n\nIn August 2017, a third of the TSC members resigned due to a dispute related to the project's code of conduct.\n\n**Current TSC Members**\n|Username|Full Name|\n|--|--|\n|aduh95|Antoine du Hamel|\n|anonrig|Yagiz Nizipli|\n|benjamingr|Benjamin Gruenbaum|\n|BridgeAR|Ruben Bridgewater|\n|gireeshpunathil|Gireesh Punathil|\n|jasnell|James M Snell|\n|joyeecheung|Joyee Cheung|\n|legendecas|Chengzhong Wu|\n|marco-ippolito|Marco Ippolito|\n|mcollina|Matteo Collina|\n|mhdawson|Michael Dawson|\n|RafaelGSS|Rafael Gonzaga|\n|richardlau|Richard Lau|\n|ronag|Robert Nagy|\n|ruyadorno|Ruy Adorno|\n|ShogunPanda|Paolo Insogna|\n|targos|Michaël Zasso|\n|tniessen|Tobias Nießen|\n\n## References\n\n## Further reading\n\n## External links\n- Official website\n\nCategories: - 2009 software\n- Free software programmed in C++\n- Free software programmed in JavaScript\n- JavaScript libraries\n- Joyent\n- Linux Foundation projects\n- Software using the MIT license"

(this runs first!)');\n\nIn this example:\n\n1. We load the built-in\n   ```\n   fs\n   ```\n   module\n2. We call\n   ```\n   readFile\n   ```\n   to read a file\n3. Node.js continues to the next line while reading the file\n4. When the file is read, our callback function runs\n\nThis non-blocking behavior lets Node.js handle many requests efficiently.... ## What Can Node.js Do?\n- **Web Servers**: Create fast, scalable network applications\n- **File Operations**: Read, write, and manage files on the server\n- **Database Interaction**: Work with databases like MongoDB, MySQL, and more\n- **APIs**: Build RESTful services and GraphQL APIs\n- **Real-time**: Handle WebSockets for live applications\n- **CLI Tools**: Create command-line applications\n\n### Example: Simple Web Server\n\nconst http = require('http'); http.createServer((req, res) => { res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'}); res.end('Hello World!'); }).listen(8080);\n\n## What is a Node.js File?\n\nNode.js files contain code that runs on the server. They usually have the\n```\n.js\n```\nextension and can be started with the\n```\nnode\n```\ncommand.\n\n- Node.js files run tasks when certain events happen (like a web request)\n- They must be started on the server to have any effect\n- They use JavaScript syntax\n\n### Example: Running a Node.js File\n\nnode app.js\n\n## Node.js Versions & LTS:\n\nNode.js releases a new major version every six months.\n\nFor stability, use an **LTS (Long Term Support)** version for production projects."

      "url": "https://nodejs.org/en/about",
      "snippet": "# About Node.js®\n\nAs an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime, Node.js is designed to build scalable network applications. In the following \"hello world\" example, many connections can be handled concurrently. Upon each connection, the callback is fired, but if there is no work to be done, Node.js will sleep.\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\n\nconst { createServer } = require('node:http');\n\nconst hostname = '127.0.0.1';\n\nconst port = 3000;\n\nconst server = createServer((req, res) => {\n\nres.statusCode = 200;\n\nres.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');\n\nres.end('Hello World');\n\n});\n\nserver.listen(port, hostname, () => {\n\nconsole.log(`Server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`);\n\n});\n\n```\n\nThis is in contrast to today's more common concurrency model, in which OS threads are employed. Thread-based networking is relatively inefficient and very difficult to use. Furthermore, users of Node.js are free from worries of dead-locking the process, since there are no locks. Almost no function in Node.js directly performs I/O, so the process never blocks except when the I/O is performed using synchronous methods of Node.js standard library. Because nothing blocks, scalable systems are very reasonable to develop in Node.js.... If some of this language is unfamiliar, there is a full article on Blocking vs. Non-Blocking.\n\nNode.js is similar in design to, and influenced by, systems like Ruby's\n\nEvent Machine and Python's Twisted. Node.js takes the event model a bit\n\nfurther. It presents an event loop as a runtime construct instead of as a library. In other systems,\n\nthere is always a blocking call to start the event-loop.\n\nTypically, behavior is defined through callbacks at the beginning of a script, and\n\nat the end a server is started through a blocking call like\n\n`EventMachine::run()`.\n\nIn Node.js, there is no such start-the-event-loop call. Node.js simply enters the event loop after executing the input script. Node.js\n\nexits the event loop when there are no more callbacks to perform. This behavior\n\nis like browser JavaScript — the event loop is hidden from the user.\n\nHTTP is a first-class citizen in Node.js, designed with streaming and low latency in mind. This makes Node.js well suited for the foundation of a web library or framework.\n\nNode.js being designed without threads doesn't mean you can't take\n\nadvantage of multiple cores in your environment. Child processes can be spawned\n\nby using our\n\n`child_process.fork()` API, and are designed to be easy to\n\ncommunicate with. Built upon that same interface is the\n\n`cluster` module,\n\nwhich allows you to share sockets between processes to enable load balancing\n\nover your cores.... ## Official Node.js Resources\n\nTo ensure authenticity and security when working with Node.js, always use official sources. Avoid trusting emails, binaries, or downloads from unofficial sources.\n\n### Official Node.js Domains\n\nFor downloading Node.js binaries and accessing official documentation, use only these domains:\n\n- nodejs.org\n\n- nodejs.dev\n\n*(Redirects to https://nodejs.org)*\n\n- iojs.org\n\n*(Redirects to https://nodejs.org)*\n\n### Official npm Packages\n\nThe Node.js team maintains the following official npm package scopes:\n\nAdditionally, the Node.js team maintains packages published by the\n\n`nodejs-foundation` npm account,\n\nthough other Node.js-related packages (like\n\n`undici`) may also be maintained by contributors closely\n\ntied to the project.\n\nUsing packages from the Node.js team guarantees that you are working with officially supported Node.js components.\n\n### Official GitHub Organizations\n\nNode.js and related projects are maintained under these official GitHub organizations:\n\n### Official Communication Channels\n\nNode.js and the OpenJS Foundation communicate through various official and community-supported channels. You can find details on how to get involved on the Get Involved page.\n\n### Reporting Website Issues & Downtime\n\nIf you encounter issues with the Node.js website, report them at the Node.js website repository. For real-time updates on outages, visit the Node.js Status Page."

      "snippet": "# Introduction to Node.js\n\nNode.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. It is a popular tool for almost any kind of project!\n\nNode.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine, the core of Google Chrome, outside of the browser. This allows Node.js to be very performant.\n\nA Node.js app runs in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request. Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library that prevent JavaScript code from blocking. In addition, libraries in Node.js are generally written using non-blocking paradigms. Accordingly, blocking behavior is the exception rather than the norm in Node.js.\n\nWhen Node.js performs an I/O operation, like reading from the network, accessing a database or the filesystem, instead of blocking the thread and wasting CPU cycles waiting, Node.js will resume the operations when the response comes back.\n\nThis allows Node.js to handle thousands of concurrent connections with a single server without introducing the burden of managing thread concurrency, which could be a significant source of bugs.\n\nNode.js has a unique advantage because millions of frontend developers that write JavaScript for the browser are now able to write the server-side code in addition to the client-side code without the need to learn a completely different language.\n\nIn Node.js the new ECMAScript standards can be used without problems, as you don't have to wait for all your users to update their browsers - you are in charge of deciding which ECMAScript version to use by changing the Node.js version, and you can also enable specific experimental features by running Node.js with flags.... ## An Example Node.js Application\n\nThe most common example Hello World of Node.js is a web server:\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\n\nconst { createServer } = require('node:http');\n\nconst hostname = '127.0.0.1';\n\nconst port = 3000;\n\nconst server = createServer((req, res) => {\n\nres.statusCode = 200;\n\nres.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');\n\nres.end('Hello World');\n\n});\n\nserver.listen(port, hostname, () => {\n\nconsole.log(`Server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`);\n\n});\n\n```\n\nTo run this snippet, save it as a\n\n`server.js` file and run\n\n`node server.js` in your terminal.\n\nIf you use mjs version of the code, you should save it as a\n\n`server.mjs` file and run\n\n`node server.mjs` in your terminal.\n\nThis code first includes the Node.js\n\n`http` module.\n\nNode.js has a fantastic standard library, including first-class support for networking.\n\nThe\n\n`createServer()` method of\n\n`http` creates a new HTTP server and returns it.\n\nThe server is set to listen on the specified port and host name. When the server is ready, the callback function is called, in this case informing us that the server is running.\n\nWhenever a new request is received, the\n\n`request` event is called, providing two objects: a request (an\n\n`http.IncomingMessage` object) and a response (an\n\n`http.ServerResponse` object).\n\nThose 2 objects are essential to handle the HTTP call.\n\nThe first provides the request details. In this simple example, this is not used, but you could access the request headers and request data.\n\nThe second is used to return data to the caller.\n\nIn this case with:\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\n\nres.statusCode = 200;\n\n```\n\nwe set the\n\n`statusCode` property to\n\n`200`, to indicate a successful response.\n\nWe set the\n\n`Content-Type` header:\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\n\nres.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');\n\n```\n\nand we close the response, adding the content as an argument to\n\n`end()`:\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\n\nres.end('Hello World\\n');\n\n```\n\nIf you haven't already done so, download Node.js."

Basically there are three parts of any application, one is Frontend with which the users are interacting, then comes to the backend server and backend database. For backend servers we can use NodeJS, Java, Python, etc. and for backend databases we use relational or non-relational databases.\n\nWhenever a client requests something from the client side of the application what happens is , the request is first sent to the server and then in that server some processing or calculations goes on for the validation of the client side request and after doing all such validation a response is sent to the client side. Basically for doing all such calculations and processing , this NodeJs framework of JavaScript is used.\n\nFor running our web applications outside the client’s browser , NodeJS is basically used as an open-source and cross platform JavaScript runtime environment.For running the server side applications we use this.For building the I/O intensive applications like video streaming sites ,online chatting applications and many other applications , it is used. Many established tech giant companies and newly created start-ups are using NodeJs framework in their company.\n\nIn 2009, NodeJs was developed by a guy called Ryan Dahla and the current version of NodeJs is v16.9.0.... ## What is Node.js?\n\nNode.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment and library for running web applications outside the client's browser. Ryan Dahl developed it in 2009, and its latest iteration, version 15.14, was released in April 2021. Developers use Node.js to create server-side web applications, and it is perfect for data-intensive applications since it uses an asynchronous, event-driven model.\n\nRelevant Read: What is NodeJS?\n\nNow that we know what is Node, let's look at why it is so prevalent in web development.\n\n## How Node.js Works\n\nNode.js is a runtime environment that allows JavaScript to be executed on the server side. It is built on the V8 JavaScript engine from Chrome, which compiles JavaScript into efficient machine code. Node.js operates on a single-threaded event-driven architecture, utilizing an event loop to handle multiple concurrent operations without blocking.\n\nWhen a client sends a request to a Node.js server, the request is added to an event queue. The event loop continuously checks this queue and processes each request. If a request involves an I/O operation, Node.js offloads it to the system kernel, which handles it asynchronously. Once the I/O operation is complete, the kernel notifies Node.js, executing the corresponding callback function.\n\nThis non-blocking I/O and event-driven model allows Node.js to handle many simultaneous connections efficiently, making it ideal for building scalable, high-performance network applications.... ## Why Do We Use NodeJs?\n\nThere are many reasons for which we prefer using NodeJs for the server side of our application, some of them are discussed in the following:\n\n- NodeJs is built on Google Chrome’s V8 engine, and for this reason its execution time is very fast and it runs very quickly.\n\n- There are more than 50,000 bundles available in the Node Package Manager and for that reason developers can import any of the packages any time according to their needed functionality for which a lot of time is saved.\n\n- As NodeJs do not need to wait for an API to return data , so for building real time and data intensive web applications, it is very useful. It is totally asynchronous in nature that means it is totally non-blocking.\n\n- The loading time for an audio or video is reduced by NodeJs because there is better synchronization of the code between the client and server for having the same code base.\n\n- As NodeJs is open-source and it is nothing but a JavaScript framework , so for the developers who are already used to JavaScript, for them starting developing their projects with NodeJs is very easy.... ## Is Node.js a Programming Language?\n\nNode.js is not a programming language; it is a runtime environment allowing you to execute JavaScript code on the server side, outside a web browser. Built on the V8 JavaScript engine from Chrome, Node.js compiles JavaScript into machine code for efficient execution. It extends JavaScript capabilities by providing additional features and libraries for server-side development, such as file system access, network communication, and asynchronous I/O operations.\n\nWhile JavaScript is the programming language used with Node.js, the runtime environment provides the tools and frameworks to build scalable and high-performance server applications. Node.js’s non-blocking, event-driven architecture makes it ideal for real-time applications, web servers, APIs, and more. In summary, Node.js is a robust environment that leverages JavaScript to enable server-side programming, but it is not a programming language.\n\n## Node.js Architecture\n\nNow that we established what is Node, let’s dig into its architecture. Node.js operates on a single-thread, allowing it to handle thousands of simultaneous event loops. Here’s a diagram, provided by Sinform.com, that best illustrates Node.js architecture.... ## Parts of Node.js\n\nFig: Parts of Node.js\n\nNow, let's go through each part of Node.js to get a better understanding of the server-side platform as a whole.\n\n### Modules\n\nModules are like JavaScript libraries that can be used in a Node.js application to include a set of functions. In order to include a module in a Node.js application, use the require() function with the parenthesis containing the name of the module.\n\nFig: Include a module in Node.js\n\nNode.js has many modules that provide the basic functionality needed for a web application. Some of them are mentioned in this table:\n\nFig: Node.js modules table\n\n### Console\n\nThe console is a module that provides a method for debugging that is similar to the basic JavaScript console provided by internet browsers. It prints messages to stdout and stderr.\n\nFig: Node.js console\n\n### Cluster\n\nNode.js is built-on on the concept of single-threaded programming. Cluster is a module that allows multi-threading by creating child processes that share the same server port and run simultaneously.\n\nA cluster can be added to an application in the following way:\n\nFig: Add cluster in Node.js\n\n### Global\n\nGlobal objects in Node.js are available in all modules. These objects are functions, modules, strings, etc. Some Node.js global objects are mentioned in the table below:\n\nFig: Global objects table... ## Applications of Node.js\n\nNode.js is a versatile runtime environment widely used for building various applications due to its efficiency and scalability. Here are some typical applications of Node.js:\n\n- Web Servers: Node.js is ideal for building fast and scalable web servers that handle numerous simultaneous connections with high throughput.\n\n- Real-Time Applications: It excels in real-time applications like chat applications, online gaming, and live collaboration tools, where real-time data updates are crucial.\n\n- APIs and Microservices: Node.js is commonly used to create RESTful APIs and microservices, facilitating communication between services in a distributed architecture.\n\n- Single-Page Applications (SPAs): Node.js serves and handles the backend logic for single-page applications, enhancing user experience with smooth, dynamic content updates.\n\n- Streaming Applications: Its asynchronous nature makes Node.js suitable for data streaming applications, such as video streaming services or real-time data processing.\n\n- Command-Line Tools: Developers use Node.js to create command-line tools and scripts that automate various tasks, leveraging its rich ecosystem of packages.\n\n- Internet of Things (IoT): Thanks to its event-driven architecture, Node.js is used in IoT applications to handle data from numerous devices in real time.\n\n## Who Uses NodeJs?\n\nWell in 2025, there are 15+ popular companies who are using NodeJs .\n\nCompanies like NASA, Trello, Netflix, PayPal, LinkedIn, Walmart, Uber, Twitter, Yahoo, eBay, GoDaddy etc are using NodeJs.... ## NPM: Node Package Manager\n\nNPM is a popular Node.js package library and the jewel in the crown of the Node.js community. It has millions of downloadable libraries, organized according to specific requirements, and is the largest software registry in the world. NPM is free. These libraries are growing fast to this very day, and they strengthen the Node.js community.... ## Conclusion\n\nNode.js is a powerful and versatile runtime environment that has revolutionized server-side programming by bringing JavaScript to the backend. Leveraging the V8 JavaScript engine, Node.js compiles code into efficient machine code, enabling high-performance execution. Its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model allows developers to easily build scalable and responsive applications capable of handling numerous concurrent connections.
