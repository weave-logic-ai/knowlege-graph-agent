# Task Log: Create Decision Nodes for Test Strategy

**Task ID**: `3.23.create_decision_nodes.1.a8c4f2`
**Agent**: Queen Coordinator (Hive Mind)
**Date**: 2025-10-23
**Duration**: 12 minutes
**Status**: ✅ Completed

---

## 📋 Task Overview

**Objective**:
Complete Phase 3 of PLANNING-REVIEW-2025-10-22.md by creating decision nodes for the test strategy documents, ensuring all test-related decisions are discoverable via the decision index and properly linked to related phases and features.

**Context**:
The TESTER agent (Hive Mind) created comprehensive test strategy documents (executive summary and full report) during Phase 5/6 planning. These documents contain critical decisions about testing frameworks, test cases, and verification steps. Phase 3 requires converting these into decision nodes for:
- Discoverability via decision index
- Impact tracking across phases and features
- Bidirectional navigation in the knowledge graph
- Decision history and rationale preservation

**Success Criteria**:
- [x] Read TEST-STRATEGY-EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY.md
- [x] Read TEST-STRATEGY-REPORT.md
- [x] Create decisions/technical/test-strategy-summary.md
- [x] Create decisions/technical/test-strategy-full-report.md
- [x] Verify all required tasks are documented in test strategy
- [x] Update PLANNING-REVIEW-2025-10-22.md to mark Phase 3 complete

**From tasks.md Line**: Referenced in PLANNING-REVIEW-2025-10-22.md Phase 3

---

## 🎯 Approach

### Strategy Selected
Used **reference-based decision nodes** rather than duplicating content:
- Decision nodes provide context, rationale, and impact analysis
- Source documents (1600-line report) remain in _planning/phases/phase 5/
- Bidirectional links enable navigation between decision nodes and source files
- Decision index serves as central hub for discoverability

### Architecture/Design Decisions
**Decision Pattern**: Option B from analysis
- Create lightweight decision nodes (TS-020, TS-021)
- Reference full report in _planning/phases/phase 5/
- Maintain single source of truth for detailed test cases
- Enable impact tracking via decision index

**Rationale**:
- Prevents duplication (DRY principle)
- Keeps decision nodes focused on "why" not "how"
- Maintains discoverability without content bloat
- Source documents can evolve independently

### Tools/Technologies Used
- Claude Code Task tool: Coordinated hive mind agents
- Read tool: Analyzed test strategy documents
- Write tool: Created decision node files
- Edit tool: Updated PLANNING-REVIEW document
- TodoWrite: Tracked progress through 7 steps

## 🚧 Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Locating Test Strategy Files
**Problem**: Initial path in PLANNING-REVIEW-2025-10-22.md referenced `_planning/phases/phase5/` but actual files were in `_planning/phases/phase 5/` (with space)
**Impact**: Initial Read tool calls failed with "file not found"
**Solution**: Used Glob tool with pattern `**/*TEST-STRATEGY*.md` to find actual file paths
**Time Lost**: 2 minutes

### Challenge 2: Balancing Detail vs. Duplication
**Problem**: 1600-line test report contains critical information but duplicating in decision node would be unwieldy
**Impact**: Decision on whether to inline full report or reference it
**Solution**: Created reference-based decision node (TS-021) that provides context and links to source document
**Time Lost**: 0 minutes (improved design)

## 💡 Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
1. **Hive Mind coordination**: Using TodoWrite with 7 concurrent steps kept work organized
2. **Reference pattern**: Decision nodes referencing source documents prevents duplication
3. **Batch operations**: Created both decision nodes in single operation for efficiency
4. **Impact tracking**: Bidirectional links enable powerful navigation in knowledge graph

### What Could Be Improved
1. **Path validation**: Should verify file paths exist before creating tasks
2. **Automation**: Task log creation should be automated (current manual process)
3. **Documenter agent**: Script execution should be triggered automatically on phase completion

### Reusable Patterns Discovered
1. **Reference-based decision nodes**: When source document is large (>500 lines), create lightweight decision node that references it rather than duplicating
2. **Impact tracking pattern**: Always link decision nodes to affected phases, features, and other decisions
3. **Bidirectional linking**: Maintain links in both directions (decision → source, source → decision)

### Mistakes to Avoid
1. **Don't duplicate large content**: Prevents maintenance burden and version drift
2. **Don't create decisions in isolation**: Always analyze impact on other decisions and phases
3. **Don't skip frontmatter**: Metadata enables filtering, searching, and automation

## 📝 Knowledge Extracted

### Episodic Memory
On 2025-10-23, completed Phase 3 of PLANNING-REVIEW-2025-10-22.md by creating two decision nodes (TS-020, TS-021) for test strategy documentation. Used reference-based pattern to avoid duplicating 1600-line test report. Process took 12 minutes with Hive Mind coordination via TodoWrite.

### Procedural Memory
**How to create reference-based decision nodes:**
1. Read source document to understand content
2. Create decision node with context and rationale
3. Add reference links to source document
4. Add impact links to affected phases/features/decisions
5. Update source document to link back to decision node (bidirectional)
6. Update index/registry documents
7. Mark phase/task as complete

### Semantic Memory
**Key concepts learned:**
- Decision nodes serve as discovery layer for detailed documentation
- Reference pattern prevents duplication while maintaining discoverability
- Impact tracking via links enables dependency analysis
- Decision index is central hub for project decision history

### Technical Memory
**Implementation details:**
- Decision IDs follow pattern: `[TYPE]-[NUMBER]` (e.g., TS-020, TS-021)
- Frontmatter must include: decision_id, decision_type, title, status, priority, category
- Status values: open, researching, decided, deferred, revisit
- Links use wikilink format: `[[path/to/file]]` or `[[path/to/file|Display Text]]`

### Context Memory
**Why decisions were made:**
- **Business context**: Decision index needed for project governance and traceability
- **Constraints**: 1600-line report too large to duplicate in decision node
- **Trade-offs**: Accepted maintaining two files (decision node + source) for better discoverability

---

## 🔗 Integration Points

### Systems Affected
- **Decision Index**: Added 2 new technical decisions (TS-020, TS-021)
- **Knowledge Graph**: Enhanced with test strategy decision nodes
- **Phase Planning**: Linked decisions to Phase 5 and Phase 6 plans

### Dependencies
- **Upstream**: Depends on test strategy documents created by TESTER agent
- **Downstream**: Future test implementation will reference these decision nodes
