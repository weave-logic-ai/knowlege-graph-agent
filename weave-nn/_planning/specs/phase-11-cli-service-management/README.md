## Overview

Phase 11 elevates Weaver from MVP to production-grade application by implementing comprehensive CLI service management, adding advanced features deferred from MVP, and introducing an revolutionary AI-powered feature creation system.

### Key Deliverables

1. **CLI Service Management**
   - Complete service lifecycle control (start/stop/restart/status)
   - Real-time monitoring and health checks
   - Centralized logging with advanced filtering
   - Performance metrics and statistics
   - Manual operation triggers

2. **MVP Future Enhancements**
   - Advanced MCP server capabilities
   - AI-powered git commit messages
   - Advanced agent rules for intelligent content analysis
   - Web-based performance dashboard
   - Long-duration stress testing (24h+)

3. **AI Feature Creator**
   - Automatic feature specification generation
   - Intelligent requirements analysis
   - Architecture planning and design
   - Ready-flag triggered auto-implementation
   - Automatic test and documentation generation

---

## Success Metrics

- ✅ All 8 service management commands functional
- ✅ 24h stress test passing with <10MB memory growth
- ✅ Feature creation generates compilable, testable code
- ✅ 85%+ test coverage across all new features
- ✅ Complete documentation for all new capabilities

## Quick Start

```bash
# After implementation
weaver start                    # Start all services
weaver status                   # Check service health
weaver logs --follow            # Stream live logs
weaver metrics                  # View performance metrics
weaver feature create "Add dark mode support"  # Create feature spec
```
