- TypeScript strict mode
- Bun package manager
- Pass typecheck + lint before completion
- No breaking changes to existing components

## Success Criteria

_Success criteria to be defined during spec-kit workflow_

## Quality Standards

All code must meet Weave-NN quality standards:

```bash
# Type checking
bun run typecheck  # Must pass with 0 errors

# Linting
bun run lint      # Must pass with 0 errors

# Build
bun run build     # Must complete successfully
```
