## Overview

Foundational concepts that define Weave-NN's identity, functionality, and technical approach. Understanding these concepts is essential for working with Weave-NN effectively.

---

## Foundation Concepts

Essential understanding for all users - start here:

- [[weave-nn|Weave-NN Project]] - Project vision, identity, and goals
- [[knowledge-graph|Knowledge Graphs]] - Core data structure for interconnected knowledge
- [[wikilinks|Wikilinks]] - Bidirectional linking syntax (`[[note-name]]`)
- [[ai-generated-documentation|AI-Generated Documentation]] - The problem we solve
- [[temporal-queries|Temporal Queries]] - Time-aware knowledge retrieval and versioning

---

## Advanced Concepts

Deeper system understanding for power users and developers:

### Graph Analysis & Topology
