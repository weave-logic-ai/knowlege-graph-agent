# Decision Tracking System

Structured system for documenting, tracking, and linking decisions throughout the knowledge graph, enabling teams to understand why choices were made and how they impact the project.

## User Story

As a **team lead**, I want to **document and track important decisions with context** so that **my team understands the rationale behind choices and can reference decisions when making related choices in the future**.

## Key Capabilities

- **Decision templates**: Standardized frontmatter structure for decision nodes (status, date, stakeholders, outcome)
- **Decision registry**: Central index showing all decisions filtered by status (proposed, approved, implemented, superseded)
- **Impact tracking**: Link decisions to affected features, nodes, and implementation work
- **Status workflow**: Move decisions through lifecycle (proposed → approved → implemented → superseded)
- **Timeline view**: Visualize decision history and understand how thinking evolved over time

## Dependencies

- **Requires**: [[knowledge-graph-visualization]] (for decision relationship visualization), [[markdown-editor-component]]
- **Enables**: Better governance, knowledge retention, and onboarding

## Implementation Notes

**Technology Stack**: Frontmatter schema validation, custom node type rendering, filtering and aggregation logic.

**Complexity Estimate**: Moderate (2-4 weeks) - requires template system, decision index/dashboard, and integration with graph visualization.

**Key Features**:
- YAML frontmatter schema for decision metadata
- Automated decision index generation from special tags/folders
- Visual indicators in graph for decision nodes
- Search and filter by decision status, category, or date range

**Template Structure**: decision_id, decision_name, category, status, decision_date, stakeholders, outcome, superseded_by.
